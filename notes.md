# Things to add

- Enemies firing back
- Enemies have states: idle, attacking, fleeing

- Smaller enemies:
	- float around in group
	- get spawned by larger bases

- bases are randomly generated using something like this:
  https://github.com/SSYGEN/blog/issues/7

- loot system based on enemy levels
	- health pickups (look like medkit?)
	- shield pickups (blue?)

- ammo pickups for different weapons?
- more weapons? infinite ammo?
- immediate mode ui for debugging/tweaking?
